   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Re-selling the author's hard work, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

2. You're allowed to modify the work for your needs. Redistribution or reselling the original or modified
work is prohibited. You can backup your modified work on private cloud storage or you can use github private
repositories for your personal use.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
